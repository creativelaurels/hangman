HANGMAN PSEUDOCODE

What are you trying to do here?

Well,

I want to have a word, consisting of letters.

I'll make that word catwoman for now.

I want to display on a screen

A message that says, press any key to start.

When any key is pressed, the game begins.

SO here is the game..

The word is catwoman. The game starts by showing a blank line for the number of letters in the word.


Like so:

  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

So displayed on the screen is some text that says:

Guesses Remaining: 10

Everytime a key is pressed that does not match, the Guesses Remaining will go down by one (i--)

Everytime a key is pressed that does not match, that letter will be listed under some text that says: Letters Already Guessed

If a key is pressed that matches a letter in the word, that letter will replace the blank line

When number of guesses remaining is equal to zero, the game is over, the player lost.

When all the blanks are filled in, the game is over, the player won and a picture of the word displays on the screen.


......


Okay lets first start by coming up with some expressions that look at 

the letter pressed by the user
and compares it to the letters in the word I've chosen for the game

var words = ['batgirl','catwoman','storm', 'rogue', 'mystique','zatanna', 'supergirl'
